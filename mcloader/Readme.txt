This is a simple dol that will mount a memory card and scan for dol files created with dol2gci, it will list them and allow to boot them.

It's main purpose is to be used with the Home Bros. Exploit, as a way to boot multiple homebrew without owning an SDGecko adapter.

Currently the needed space is 9 blocks on the memory card.


Installing dol files to the memory card:
----------------------------------------

To install dol files to the memory card, convert them with dol2gci, then install them to the memory card with your preferred method. You can use GCMM for that: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/GCMM

note: the name of the file on the memory card will be that of the dol file BEFORE converting it with dol2gci. After the conversion is done, renaming the gci file will have no impact on the memory card filename.

CLI Embedder 0.1 by suloku 15'
******************************

This program will embedd a cli file into a gci file created with dol2gci.

Usage: cliembed.exe mydol.gci
       or drag and drop to executable file

Cli file must have the same name and be in the same path as gci file:
        swiss.gci and swiss.cli


In case that the cli file is too big for the gci file padding, the program will ask you if you want to create a new gci file with an aditional block. After the file is created, use the new file with cliembed and you will be able to embed your cli file.
